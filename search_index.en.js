better indexes for some packfiles, noticeably improved\nfetch/push speed, deprecation2 of whatchanged and promotion\nof switch and restore out of experimental status (though checkout is not\ngoing anywhere).\nYet, to the diphasic3 end-user,\nthe unassuming highlight of this release is the ability to share your stashes\nthrough your remote: let's check it out!\n\n⚓\nObligatory TL;DR\n\nThis creates a new ref called my-stash under refs/stashes/ and pushes it\nupstream (to a remote whose name is origin).\nOn another machine, fetch all remote stashes and import the one you want:\n\nThe fetch command uses a\nrefspec to fetch\nall stashes under refs/stashes/ and store them locally under the same path:\n&lt;remote-ref&gt;:&lt;local-ref&gt;.  The + is equivalent to --force, to overwrite\nany existing local ref or the same name.\n\n⚓\nStashes were inherently local\nUntil now, your stashes lived only as reflog under a single ref/stash\nreference, which is not only fairly impractical for programmatic manipulation,\nbut also means that all but the latest one essentially only existed locally on\nyour host.\nIf you wanted to move them elsewhere, you had to resort to savvy (let's not call\nthem \"awkward\") workarounds: patch files, stash branches, cherry-picking...\nAnything would go, with the exception of outright copying entire files or trees\non your file system, I'm sure.\n⚓\nAren't they just usable commits under the hood?\n\"Jein\" (\"yes and no\"), as my German colleagues would say; you could always git show stash@{0} and see it in all its splendour to find out:\n\nnote the nifty cd $(mktemp -d): you may follow along by copy-pasting without risk\nHere, I create a repository with a single commit containing a single empty file,\nfile.  I add two lines to it, then stage the first one but not the second.  I\nalso create an untracked file, other-file, then I stash all my changes.\nWhat have we done?!  Here's the monstrosity:\n\n\nthe diff --cc will show the \"combined diff\", when a commit has several parents (a \"merge commit\")\n⚓\nOne stash, several commits\nLet's not go today over how precisely to decipher the content of an octopus\ncommit4, when a picture may well be worth a thousand words:\n\n\nWould you look at that!  Your stash isn't one commit, it's possibly three:\none for each of your staged, your unstaged, and your untracked changes,\nrespectively.\n⚓\nA fourth parent with 2.51\nDo you know what the stash commit needs?  More parents, of course!\nWith Git 2.51, you may opt into a new representation of your stashes, which\nwill have one more parent.  It's actually only a bit of a joke5,\nsince in reality we're talking of an extra commit with two parents, on top of\nyour current commit with three parents.\nThe export subcommand to git stash lets you use that new format.  With it,\nyou need to use one of the --print or --to-ref &lt;ref&gt; options, to either\ndisplay the hash of the new stash commit or save it under a specific ref,\nrespectively.\n\n\nget the hash of your stash's new variant representation with export --print\nLet's open it up and see what it hides:\n\n\nthe a196b1a commit (second parent) is the regular, historical \"stash commit\", stash@\nThis is the same command as before, except that where I would before use\nstash@{0} as the reference to log, I now use $(git stash export --print stash@{0}) instead, to use the new model.\nThe additional commit introduced under this new format is 3e57536, whose\nparents are a196b1a (the \"regular\", historical stash commit) and 73c9bab.\nWhat is 73c9bab?  Just an entire secondary history to your\nrepository!\nThis alternative initial commit is only a dummy one, to mark the base of your\nstash stack:\n\n\nAs a fun tidbit, that date is essentially some sort of quirky\n\"Git epoch\".

See format-patch's\ndocumentation.\n⚓\nYour stash stack\nFinally, we arrive at the point of this entire article: stashes that used to only\nbe available through the reflog of refs/stash now properly exist as a\nbunch of references that you can actually push and fetch.  You may even move\naround your entire stack, or any subset of it, at once.\nLet's push another stash:\n\nThat new stash (whose message I set, to avoid confusion) is now the top of our\nstash stack:\n\n\nthe new stash, 157c3dc, is at the top of the stack, stash@{0}, or refs/stash\nAs a reminder, here's the earlier stash, now at stash@{1}:\n\n\nthe earlier stash, a196b1a, is now the second entry on the stack, stash@{1}, but no more refs/stash\nThe new model for stashes allow us to refer to our entire stash stack\ndirectly, since they'll be parents of one another, provided that you want this\nbehaviour.\nNote that you may pass a list of stashes to git stash export --print or omit\nthem altogether to export the stack in its entirety:\n\n\nyes, I'll admit, this looks mad\nTry to focus on the leftmost branch: that's your stash stack, with ba4fea2 at\nthe top, 3e57536 next, and 73c9bab (the dummy initial \"stash stack\" commit)\nat the bottom.\nVoilà!  You need only your one reference from git stash export --print, and\ncan carry around your entire stash stack.\n⚓\nSo what?\nThere's a counterpart to the --print option: --to-ref &lt;ref&gt; lets you export\nyour stash stack (in its newly introduced model) to a proper Git ref, which you\ncan then push and fetch like any other reference:\n\nThere we go, refs/my-stash is there.  You can lose and recover it all with\nease:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd of course, you can push and fetch refs/my-stash to and from any remote\nrepository, just like any other ref.\n\nThen, on another machine:\n\nThough I should point out that the emerging consensus suggests to keep things a\nbit more organised, and use refs/stashes/&lt;name&gt; instead of refs/&lt;name&gt;; I'll\nadopt this convention going forward.\n⚓\nA note on garbage collection\nRemember that these are dangling refs, and as such are subject to garbage\ncollection, if you've skilfully set up your repository.  Chances are that your\nGit host provider does by default end up pruning these after a while: nobody\nwants to keep around stale references forever that aren't reachable from any\nbranch or tag.\nHave fun!\n\n\n\nGit 2.51 (release notes)\nwas released on August 18, 2025. ↩\n\n\nWith 2.51, git whatchanged shall only function when paired\nwhen invoked with the --i-still-use-this flag, just like pack-redundant was,\n2 years ago.

Here, I'll lay the foundations for your\nhorizontal text alignment needs, from the CLI.\n⚓\nUsing column\nIn the introductory piece of this article, I proposed a classification for\nthe various forms of textual horizontal alignment.  The first three are mundane\nenough to be easily achieved using nothing but a pair of trustworthy tools;\nchief among them is column.\n⚓\nThe list in a grid\nIf your items are begging to fit on a single screenful of text, you can lay\nthem out in a grid with column:\n\n\nIt wants to print out columns of unique width, regardless of their individual\ncontent.\nBy default, it uses tabulations, but you may have it use spaces with the\n--use-spaces/-S flag, which takes the minimum number of whitespaces to\nseparate columns by:\n\n\n\n\nUnless instructed otherwise, it will fill its grid column-first, but you can\nalso have it go row by row with --fillrows/-x:\n\n\nAvoiding the --fillrows flag yields grids that are generally more evenly\npacked, provided that your display is wide enough to accommodate more of your\nitems as you'd need rows to contain them all.  Either case will use exactly as\nmany rows as necessary.\n⚓\nThe tabular data\nIf you find yourself wanting to create a proper table, column again has got\nyou covered: use its --table/-t flag to have it create or manipulate tabular\ndata.\nConsider the case of /etc/passwd:\n\n\nnote the startling absence of a UUOC\nWatch it now blossom into its intended form, fit for human consumption:\n\n\nBut that's not all: column really lets you manipulate that data table in\na myriad of ways.  Name columns, shuffle them around, truncate or wrap their\ncontent, hide them...  Have at it!\n\n\nHowever, the above is rather extreme: I generally limit myself\nto the -t, -s, -o (and on occasion, -R) flags, preferably preparing data upstream\nwith composable tools that I use often enough to need not browse the trusty\nmanual:\n\n\nthis command is essentially equivalent to the one above it\n⚓\nA note on field selection\nNow probably comes time to touch on touch on cut, which justly sounds like a fated\npartner to paste.\nAt its core, cut merely serves to carve out chunks (\"fields\") from\nyour lines.  Specify the delimiter by which to delineate your fields with\n--delimiter/-d, and extract the ones you need with --fields/-f:\n\n\n{{ note(msg= select fields 1 and 6  ) }}\nNote that you may identify 1-indexed, comma-separated fields, or ranges,\npossibly open-ended:\n\n1,3,5 selects fields 1, 3 and 5,\n1-3 means 1 through 3,\n-5 is 5 and below, and\n3- is 3 and beyond.\n\nWith column, the various field-selecting flags behave similarly, with some\nnotable extensions: you may use the 0 field alone to denote all fields, or\nuse negative indices to target fields from the end.  Thus, -1 is the last\nfield, -2 is the penultimate field and so on.\nThis has the consequence of invalidating the range notation that uses an open\nlower bound: where -3 would mean 1 through 3 in cut, it means third field\nfrom the end in column.\n⚓\nUsing paste\nHere we are, where it gets good, paste is what we'd been after all along.  It only gets\nintroduced now because it requires cooperation from its friends to get the job\nyou likely want done.\n⚓\nThe adjoined and annotated fragments\nAt last, there's data that's not quite tabular enough to be called that...\nyet!

Precisely never, were it not for everything\nbeing a file (descriptor): you can also paste the output of commands together\n(beware the non-POSIX Bashism, however):\n\n\n\nthese are still tabulations\nYou can just about feel that there's something usable there, but we'll have to\naddress some tab-related limitations before unearthing this treasure:\n\n\ndata may overflow past the tabulations stops\n\n\n\nimbalanced datasets also create problems (the recall command is made up)\nThe remedy is the --delimiters/-d flag, which pairs delightfully well\nwith column -ts in a real ah-ha moment:\n\n\n\n\ncircling back to the /etc/passwd format\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, this treatment is only curative if you can identify a symbol that\nyour data doesn't contain.  We could almost make it a panacea, were it not for\nwhat I consider a quirk of paste.\nAs you'll have noted, the --delimiters flag is plural: it can cycle\nthrough a list of ASCII characters to use instead of tabulations.\nRegardless of the practicality of this feature, its implementation has paste\nconsider each byte as a distinct delimiter: committing to an esoteric Unicode\ncharacter that spans several bytes will therefore not do you any good.\nHere are a few examples for illustration, which are most probably best\nconsumed with the questions likely raised by the above paragraph still on your\nmind:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'll allow cat here, for - - -\n\n\nI did alter xxd's\noutput for simplicity, and attempted to provide reasonably adequate\nhighlighting, which I hope to be more helpful than it is confusing.\n⚓\nClosing words\nNote that, if you want to add line numbers or timestamps of all kinds, you\nshould prefer nl (from coreutils) or ts (from moreutils) to paste.\nThat's it, this article boils down to: paste &lt;(left) &lt;(right) and column -ts:, with some -d: passed here and there to cut or paste where\nnecessary.

The one practical difference between an\niterator (what the generator constructs) and a regular\ncollection (like an Array) is that values are only computed when they're\nrequested: you may generate an infinite sequence of values, for instance.\n⚓\nDefining a generator\nA generator function is declared using the function* syntax. Inside, the\nyield keyword is used to emit values one at a time:\n\nYou may also use the function* expression:\n\nOr even extract its constructor to create such functions dynamically:\n\noh yeah, JavaScript has no problem (de)serialising code on the fly: quine enthusiasts, take note!\nThere is however no equivalent arrow function syntax for generators.\n⚓\nUnder the hood: an iterable iterator\nCalling a generator function returns an\niterator\nobject.  Well, it even is an iterable iterator, like most will be.\n⚓\nThe iterator protocol\nAn iterator is an instance providing a next() method that returns an object\nwith two properties:\n\nvalue, the yielded value, and\ndone, a boolean indicating whether the generator has completed.\n\nTechnically, both properties are optional: you may very well yield undefined\nat any time, and the omission of done is equivalent to having it be false.\nAn iterator is fairly simple to use: call its next() method to get the\nsubsequent value; when done is true, the iterator is exhausted.\nIn the case of a generator function*, the first call to next() executes the\nfunction until the first yield.  Subsequent calls to next() will resume\nexecution until the next yield instruction, or until the function returns (or\nfinishes), at which point it'll systematically reply with done and no further\nvalues are produced.\n\nNote that the value after exhaustion is typically undefined, unless you\nexplicitly return a value from the generator; however, know that this final\nvalue is disregarded entirely by standard API constructs such as for..of loops\nand the spread operator:\n\nthe (oft left undefined) final return value is ignored by consumers of iterable\n... Which makes for a neat segue into the next section.\n⚓\nThe iterable interface\nAn iterable is an instance providing a [Symbol.iterator]()2\nmethod that returns an iterator.  This is essentially JavaScript's take on\ncomposition, a superior alternative to inheritance.\nIn practice, the iterator protocol is virtually never implemented without also\nproviding an iterable interface, as most (all?) standard syntaxes and APIs\nare designed to work with iterables rather than raw iterators.\nGenerator function*s return values that are iterable.  As such, you can (for\nexample) use them in for..of loops:\n\nNote that Arrays, Strings, Maps, Sets, and possibly other built-in\ntypes also implement the iterable interface3.\n\nthe last one also employs array destructuring, a fan-favourite from ES6\n⚓\nNot just for..of\nWith ES6 also came a slew of new syntaxes and APIs designed to work with\niterables, including but not limited to:\n\n\nThe spread operator (...), which expands an iterable into individual\nelements.  You can use it to pass values as separate arguments to a function\nor to create an array literal with it:\n\n\n\nThe assignment destructuring, which also may work over iterables to\ndeclare and initialise multiple values at once:\n\n\n\nThe rest parameter syntax, which collects multiple values into an array:\n\n\n\nThere is still some more brought by ES6 with regards to integration with\niterables, as well as a lot more general, unrelated goodness that came with\nit, but I should bring this article back on topic and to an end: how about the\npractical use of generator functions in the wild?\n⚓\nA practical example\nBecause their values are, as their name would heavily suggest, generated on\ndemand, you can use generators to create, for instance, infinite iterators:\n\nAlright, it's good to know, but I was only messing with you: I'm yet to develop\nthe need for an infinite sequence that isn't served just as well by a simple\nmutable number counter or some other mechanism entirely.\nThere was however still one\ntime that I\nfigured would call for a generator function*.  It wasn't the code that ran the\nfastest, but the most elegant4 one—though I welcome challenges to that\nclaim.\nIt was implementing a solution to Reshape the\nMatrix, LeetCode's challenge #566, despite the typo\nin my PR referring to #556, which reads:\n\nIn MATLAB, there is a handy function called reshape which can reshape an m x n matrix into a new one with a different size r x c keeping its original\ndata.\nYou are given an m x n matrix mat and two integers r and c representing\nthe number of rows and the number of columns of the wanted reshaped matrix.\nThe reshaped matrix should be filled with all the elements of the original\nmatrix in the same row-traversing order as they were.\nIf the reshape operation with given parameters is possible and legal, output\nthe new reshaped matrix; Otherwise, output the original matrix.\n\nHere's my generator-based solution (revisited for brevity and clarity):\n\nDon't take my word for it: try for yourself to implement this solution;\nchances are it's only then that you'll best appreciate the generator\nfunction*.\nThough nowadays, for this specific example, I might rather reach for\nArray#flat instead which, contrary to a naive belief, actually performs\nbetter.\nAnd don't hesitate to share with me if you ever come across a legitimate use for\nJavaScript's generators: I would love to know what you're tinkering with.\n\n\n\nECMAScript is the\nstandard, the specification; JavaScript is the language built on that standard,\nplus some extra features (such as Web APIs, like the DOM), for browsers. ↩\n\n\nSymbols are special, unique identifiers in JavaScript, also\nintroduced in ES6: maybe they deserve an entry of their own sometime. ↩\n\n\nNote that plain Objects do not implement\nthe iterable interface, and are broken down with Object.entries(),\nObject.keys(), or Object.values() instead. ↩\n\n\nElegance is subjective, but 3 measly statements with no mutable\nvariables has got to beat alternatives!

The selected quote is finally written to $MAIL, in a format\nsuitable for plain-text e-mails:\n\nit'll be highlighted sensibly in your editor\nOn with the last two steps: if the user did select a quote, they'll get to edit\ntheir e-mail in their favourite $EDITOR, with adequate highlighting for the\ne-mail format.  When they're done, if they neither emptied or deleted the file,\nnor emitted an error (:cq), their e-mail is sent off to the unsuspecting\nrecipient:\n\nThere you go, all in a few lines of shell scripting, while you're out\nand about surfing the command line.

If you merely use it sporadically to search and replace\ntext from the CLI, and have no interest in reaching for this trusty tool for\nanything else, you may want to know of a very popular alternative that somewhat\nsimplifies that specific task: sd.\nThe finer folks will find boundless treasures in the venerable manual pages,\nand perhaps a few tips and tricks scattered online, such as those I plan to\npublish on this very platform.\n\nThe POSIX man\npages of sed are more complete than that of its GNU implementation:\nyou may run man 1p sed to access the POSIX version for a more\nfaithful (and universal) reference; however GNU offers a significantly\nmore exhaustive version through either info sed or its on-line\nversion.\n\n\n\n⚓\nObligatory TL;DR\nYou can limit the scope over which sed commands operate by preceding them\nwith one or two addresses.  An address may be a line number, a regular\nexpression, or a few other special forms.\n\n\n⚓\nThe anatomy of a sed command\nA sed command takes the following form:\n\nIn this syntax, function represents a single-character command verb in\nsed, followed by any applicable arguments.  The most common function is s,\nwhich stands for substitute, but you'll find numerous others, such a d for\ndelete, p for print, a for append...1\n\nTo keep things readable (we wield regular expressions but we're not animals),\nthe addresses and function can be preceded and/or followed by blank\ncharacters.  The command in its entirety, [address[,address]]function,\nmay be preceded and/or followed by blank and/or semicolon characters.\n\nOne last, simple yet quite useful trick regarding line selection: you can\nnegate the selection over which a function shall operate by preceding it\nwith an exclamation mark (!), which will cause the command to be executed on\nall lines except those addressed.\nEach function you can execute may take up to either zero, one, or two\naddresses.\n⚓\nThe forms of addresses\nAn address may take one of the following forms:\n\n\na decimal number that counts input lines cumulatively across files\n(1-indexed),\n\n\na dollar sign ($) character, which references the last line of input, or\n\n\na context address, which consists of a BRE as described here in the complete GNU sed manual\non-line,\npreceded and followed by a delimiter—usually a forward slash (/).\n\nUsing GNU sed, using a different delimiter in the context of\naddresses requires a backslash (\\) before the preceding\ndelimiter.  For example, to use a hash 2 as the delimiter, with\nGNU sed, you'd write \\#regexp# instead of #regexp#.\nIn addition, GNU's implementation introduces the /re/I and /re/M\nsyntaxes\nfor case-insensitive and multi-line matching, respectively.  Most often\nin other contexts these flags are lower-case, but GNU sed offers a\nwould-be conflicting i function verb for insert that couldn't be\ninterpreted adequately, had the flags been i and m instead of I and\nM.\n\n\n\nTo these POSIX standards, GNU sed adds the following option:\n\n\nthe first~step form, where first and step are both decimal numbers.\nThis matches one every every step lines, starting with first.  For\nexample, 1~2 matches all odd-numbered lines, while 2~2 matches the even\nones.\n\n\n⚓\nAddress ranges\nIn sed, most commands can be given with:\n\n\nno addresses, in which case the command will be executed for all input\nlines,\n\n\none address, then only input lines which match that address will be\nconsidered, or\n\n\ntwo addresses, in which case the command will operate over all input lines\nmatching the inclusive range of lines starting from the first address and\ncontinuing to the second address.\n\nThe syntax is address1,address2 (that is, the addresses are separated\nby a comma); the line which address1 matched will always be accepted,\neven if address2 selects an earlier line; and if address2 is a regular\nexpression, it will not be tested against the line that address1 matched.\n\n\n\nUsing two addresses allows you to target ranges\nof lines where the two addresses serve as\nflip-flop markers: when\nthe first address is matched, if we're currently outside a match range, we start\nprocessing the input lines for that command, until the second address is matched\nor the end of the input is reached.\n⚓\nSome GNU sed-specific pseudo-addresses\nThe GNU version of sed introduces three pseudo-addresses that may only\nbe used in the context of address ranges, and aren't valid as stand-alone\naddresses:\n\n\n+N and ~N, where N is a decimal number, only available to the second\nof an address pair:\n+N matches the line that is N lines after that of the first address, ~N\nmatches the lines whose number is a multiple of N.\n\n\n0, which may only be used as the first of an address pair.  It is most\nesoteric and only included here for completeness.  The special 0,address2\nsyntax is used to:\n\nStart out in \"matched first address\" state, until address2 is found.  This\nis similar to 1,address2, except that if address2 matches the very first\nline of input the 0,address2 form will be at the end of its range, whereas\nthe 1,address2 form will still be at the beginning of its range.  This\nworks only when address2 is a regular expression.\n\n\n\nWell, that's a lot of theory, but nothing quite scary in practice, though I\nsuppose some demonstrations are in order.\n⚓\nExempli gratia\nHere are some examples of addresses and address ranges in action, using\nthe delete command:\n\nIt is also possible to use regular expressions as addresses:\n\nYou may target some function from a script:\n\n\nyou can use white space in the [address[,address]]function pattern for better readability\nYou can also retain only that function, one of two ways:\n\ndon't hesitate to use white-space, /function handleanything/,  /^}$/  !d is also legal\nFor instance, you may refer to some of your favourite manual entries in this way:\n\n\n⚓\nA real-life scenario\nAnother quick tip: if you find yourself wanting to substitute some text\nonly on certain lines, you don't necessarily have to complicate your regular\nexpression.\nLet's take the example of some nginx configuration:\n\nSuppose that you want to avoid performing SSL\ntermination in your\nreverse proxy: you'll need to change occurrences of http to https.\nHere's the diff you'd obtain after running a naive sed 's/http/https/' nginx.conf:\n\nOops, we don't actually want to change the comment line nor the protocol\n(there's no https2), but only the proxy_pass directives.\nYou could revise your regular expression to something like:\n\nThat would work, but...  Good grief.\nEven if you're comfortable with regular expressions in the first place,\nand with the BRE flavour whenever necessary, in addition to the PCRE dialect I'm sure\nyou'll often favour, that's still a troublesome incantation not only to read,\nbut even to write: you may very well, for instance, forget about the pesky\nmultiple spaces for horizontal alignment in your first attempt!\nA more idiomatic sed way would be to scope your substitution to the lines containing\nproxy_:\n\nthe second version is also entirely legal syntax, it merely adds white-space for readability\nHow real-life is that, though?  Wouldn't you just spin up your favourite text\neditor at this point?\nCertainly.  But you'll be happy to know that your favourite text editor offers the same function!\n\nVim is more lenient and tolerates omitting the final / at the end of the replacement pattern\nYou could also have selected the location blocks:\n\nOr maybe all lines following /app1:\n\nfor illustration, I used hashes (#) to delineate the RegExp here, to not have to escape the literal /\nOr lines 5 and onwards:\n\nThe world is your oyster!  Know your options, start using them here and there,\nyou'll find what works for you and maybe best accommodate your tools to your\ntaste.\n⚓\nOne savvy application I use all the time\nI'll share here a part of my personal prepare-commit-msg Git\nhook,\nwhich runs every time I commit anything anywhere and prepares the commit\ntemplate to my liking.\nI use the --verbose flag when committing, so that Git shows me:\n\n[...] a unified diff between the HEAD commit and what would be committed at\nthe bottom of the commit message template to help the user describe the commit\nby reminding what changes the commit has.\n\nIn summary, instead of being presented with:\n\n\nYou would instead have:\n\n\nI like having a recap of my changes below the scissors line\nQuite handy, yet too noisy.

Just as well, you may redirect its output\nto an any other file descriptor using one (or more!) of five (or 6, with the\nHERESTRING Bashism) redirection operators:\n\n&lt; redirects stdin from a file descriptor\n&gt; redirects stdout to a file descriptor\n&gt;&gt; appends stdout to a file descriptor\n&lt;&lt; redirects stdin from an in-line document (HEREDOC)\n&lt;&lt;&lt; redirects stdin from an in-line string (HERESTRING, non-POSIX!)\n| pipes stdout from a command to stdin of another\n\nLet's explore the few things to know about each.\n⚓\nInput redirection: &lt;\nThe dead simple &lt; operator redirects a file descriptor to FD 0.  Whereas\nsort invoked on its own would have you type your input, you may have it sort\nthe files of a file on disk instead:\n\n\n\nthis uses unsorted.txt as standard input\n\n\n\nIt may take a FD number, too, to redirect to a file descriptor other than\n0, the standard input.  For instance, you may redirect FD 3\nto the contents of unsorted.txt:\n\nThe above is of dubious interest, since sort doesn't do anything with its FD 3.\nnb.: Going forward, I'll invoke sort with a file descriptor as its first\npositional argument, which will have it read from there instead of stdin.\n⚓\nOutput redirection: &gt;\nA counterpart to &lt;, the &gt; operator redirects a file descriptor to FD 1.\nWhereas sort invoked on its own would print its output to the terminal, you\nmay have it write the sorted output to a file on disk instead:\n\n\nthis has no visible output, since stdout was redirected to sorted.txt\n\n\n\n\n\nJust like &lt;, it may take a FD number, to redirect to to another descriptor.\nA fairly common use case is to redirect FD 2, the standard error output, to a\nfile, so that you can inspect it later:\n\n\nerrors.txt would contain any error output\nYou may redirect both stdout and stderr at the same time, using the &amp;&gt;\noperator, though it is not POSIX-compliant.\n⚓\nAppending output: &gt;&gt;\nThe &gt;&gt; operator is similar to &gt;, but appends to the file descriptor\ninstead of overwriting it.  This is useful when you want to keep the previous\ncontents of a file and add new data to it, rather than replacing it.\nIt also understands a file descriptor number, like the two operators above.\n⚓\nHere Document: &lt;&lt;\nThe &lt;&lt; operator redirects a here document (abbreviated HEREDOC) to\nFD 0.  A here document is a way to provide input to a command directly\nwithin the script or command line, rather than from a separate file.\nFor instance, you can use it to sort a list of items without having to create a\nseparate file:\n\n\nOnce again, it may take a file descriptor number, to redirect to a file\ndescriptor other than 0, the standard input.  There are a few more things\nthat make HEREDOC uniquely useful, which I go over in a complementary\narticle.\n⚓\nHere String: &lt;&lt;&lt;\nDisclaimer: this one is not part of the POSIX standard.\nThe &lt;&lt;&lt; operator redirects a here string to FD 0.  A here string is a\nway to provide a single line of input to a command directly within the script or\ncommand line, rather than from a separate file or a here document.  For example,\nyou can use it to sort a single line of text:\n\n\n\n&lt;&lt;&lt; isn't part of the POSIX specification\n\n\n\n&lt;&lt;&lt; and $'...' make this doubly non-POSIX\n\nSince you'll already be using Bashisms if you're there, you may like to know\nthat the $'...' (ANSI-C quoting) allows you, in bash, zsh and other\npopular interactive interpreters, to interpret backlash escape sequences much\nlike C string literals would.  There, \\n is a linefeed, \\t a tabulation,\n\\x20 is a byte with the hexadecimal value 20 (a whitespace), \\u20AC is\nthe Unicode character with code point U+20AC (the Euro sign), and so on.\n⚓\nCommand piping: |\nThe | operator pipes the standard output (stdout, FD 1) of one command to\nthe input (stdin, FD 0) of another.  Simple, obvious, effective; this lets\nyou chain commands together, passing the output of one command as input to the\nnext.  We talk then of pipeline, as opposed to simple commands; though these\nterms appear more in the literature than in the day-to-day vernacular.\nFor example, you can use it to sort a list of items generated by another\ncommand:\n\n\nthe \\n are interpreted by printf and therefore aren't non-POSIX constructs here!\nAnd there we are!

I'll keep referring to these as AI, for it sadly\nis the established vernacular.\n\nI'd like to start with something that's not often talked about: the AI\nthat's now available to us is a huge achievement, something that'd been\ndreamt since the inception of computing, perhaps even before.  In my teenage\nyears, I grew up with Asimov's\nFoundation and Robot series.  I also remember the iconic\nHAL 9000's eerie \"I\nthink you know what the problem is just as well as I do\",\nK.I.T.T. as the original\nJ.A.R.V.I.S.,\nGLaDOS's sinister humour in yet another\nof Valve's game-changing accomplishments, and Star Wars' beloved C-3PO and\nR2-D2 doing their best Laurel\nand Hardy impression.\nThat's quite a few acronyms2, come to think of it.  We should consider\nchristening (ha!) our first Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) something\nlike SAGE, for Self-Adapting General Entity.  Or whatever OVERLORD might spell\nout, to tease the soothsayers.  But I digress.\nWe are now somewhere.  We can, albeit at a strenuous (if not staggering)\ncomputational cost, have machines that can \"understand\" and respond in a natural\nlanguage.  It is now unequivocally workable as a long-awaited solution to be\nrefined in the years to come.\n\nAs a programming companion, however, it's of very little use to me.\n\nI like my craft.  I refined it enormously and have achieved some mastery in\nsome regards that I'm certain is far from being available to the general public,\nwould they even by armed with the World-Wide-Web and aided by some companions of\nthe artificial kind.\n\nIf I use a tool to author and compose code for me, I rob myself of the\nopportunity and experience of thinking through the problem, arriving at a\nsolution, possibly trudging on my way there and only then realising that a\nsmoother path should be available.\nAfter some decades of this, the most excellent of us end up developing some\nsense for these mechanisms, as we've built similar things in different ways,\nin different cultural and technological contexts, using different tools, for\ndifferent purposes.\n\nNone of this corresponds to any sort of experience that the current\nLLMs could at all contemplate acquiring: they have no experience of\ntheir own.  They exist in a fantasy world dreamed up from the weighted\nstatistically average (or popular?) amalgamation of (only) the written report\nof third parties; it certainly doesn't \"learn\" in any human sense.  Richard\nSutton (a foundational figure\nin modern artificial intelligence) puts it well: learning isn't just about\ntraining, it's an active process.\nThe general-purpose programming assistant is nothing like having a\ngeneral-purpose tool that would have been careful crafted to perform a\nspecific task, possibly rather through reinforcement learning rather than mere\nvaguely supervised mimicry training on a large corpus of text.\nAnd of course, with general-purpose chatting engines come the yet-to-be-solved\nissues regarding, off the top of my head:\n\noutright dangerous rhetoric or instructions,\n\"hallucinations\" (i.e., confidently stating falsehoods),\nbiases inherited from the training data, and\nintellectual property and data privacy concerns.\n\nThere's also the seeping, encroaching problem of the horrifyingly inadequate\nappeal to authority\nbias that we are getting increasingly subject to, using sources whose influence\nonly gets further and further ahead of their competency.\n\nMy third point is that, under the hypothesis that we are to keep signing off on\nthe code that an AI produces for us, the argument should be made that—to the\nfanatic developer at least—the mechanical act of curating the codebase is\ncertainly not the bottleneck in building perennial software.\nOn that note, a close colleague of mine confided just this week that reviewing\ncode may more strenuous than authoring it, depending on how diligent one wants\nto be.  It may have to do with the pull in opposing directions: you need to\nappropriate the entire context in the first place, but wouldn't quite dare, at\nthis point, even considering alternative solutions.\nIn any case, correctly identifying and contextualising the problem, the\nsolution space, the implicit and explicit constraints, the trade-offs to\nbe made with regards to maintainability, performance, security, etc. are\nindisputably the more costly (and valuable) parts of the process.  Having the\nartificial assistant execute the plan is not, in the general cases where the\nalternative would be that I personally fly through text documents, much of a\ntime-saver.\nAnd again, that's assuming the end result is correct under scrutiny—which it\nisn't always, let alone exemplary, let alone graceful.\n\nIn short, I am, intrinsically, somebody that does stuff.  Not because I\ncan't delegate, not because I need the stuff done (though sometimes I do), but\nbecause I was plagued and blessed with a profound obsession for refining my\ncraft.  And I was afforded the luxury of being born just in time for not only\nsoftware being a major, obvious, lucrative industry, but also the notion that\ncare, skill and experience can make a tremendous difference in the quality of\nthe resulting product.\nI come from a time when every kid at school heard that we wouldn't always have a\ncalculator in our pocket; when, if we played video games, it'd be the few that\nwere available, over and over; when the first consoles were requiring great\ningenuity just to have a counter-melody play over the main theme and sprites\nwould flicker to work around memory constraints; when access to a digital, let\nalone on-line! encyclopaedia was an indulgence; in summary, I come from a time\nwhere the family camera and the family computer would never have been thought to\nsoon be available as a single, personal device.  And I'm not that old!\nYet, the Discord\nof today is substantially more sluggish than the MSN\nMessenger of\nyesteryear.  It does far more, certainly, but I do realise that\nhardware and networking have come a long, long way since I took my\nfirst steps into IRC servers and\nBBS Websites; to my\nunderstanding, there still is room for some excellence even in the execution\nof the vision.\n\nAI will get better.  It already is of great value as a preliminary to some\nsearch engine queries.  It's pretty great at getting some vaguely mushy\nimplementation that mostly does the thing you asked it for.  But that is not\nremotely enough to pique my fervent interest:\nIt does what we asked it for...  But what if we were misguided?  The\nwell-travelled quote \"the customer is always right\" should be followed by:\n\"in matters of taste\".\nWe built what the marketing department sold...  But what of the\n-ilities?\nWhat of the cut-throat, no-nonsense, ruthless pragmatism where one could\nwant to do away with dependencies and frameworks altogether?  If made\nto optimise, could it avoid doing it prematurely—the root of all\nevil, as proposed by the\nillustrious Donald Knuth?\nWe've arrived at a set of nascent tools that will help and get\nbetter.  Once again, a new fad is upon us, just as the past two decades\nbrought us the Big Data\ncraze, the NoSQL movement, the\nMicroservices bandwagon,\nthe REST cult, the Event\nSourcing phase...\nIn some contexts, these are the right tools; in general, they merely serve to\nindicate when about were these solutions designed and built.\nWill our own systems and products stand the test of time, or shall we right\naway mandate Vibe Coding to faster\nimplement complexity3?\n\n\n\nArtificial sentience is yet to be incepted\nelectronically, to be best of my understanding.  Although, who am I to\njudge—am I even conscious to\nbegin with? ↩\n\n\n\nK.I.T.T. stands for Knight Industries Two Thousand,\nJ.A.R.V.I.S. for Just A Rather Very Intelligent System,\nGLaDOS for Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System, and\nHAL for Heuristically Programmed Algorithmic Computer (go figure).\n\nThe names of Star Wars' iconic droids are more the result of chance than\ndeliberate acronyms. ↩\n\n\nBeing a proponent of radical simplicity, I\nmay smugly smirk at the idea, yet I shudder at the realisation that some serious\npeople are indeed in favour of such mandates, and in position to put them into\npractice. ↩\n\n\n\n","id":"https://ccjmne.sh/blog/ramblings/the-advent-of-ai/","title":"The advent of AI"},"https://ccjmne.sh/blog/ramblings/the-hidden-value-of-the-job-web-done/":{"body":"Once in a while, a project ends up completely off-course.  We end up having to\nfix something that was never part of the original plan, something that appears\nentirely unrelated to the actual problem we're attempting to solution: I\noften have in mind that one opening to some episode of Malcolm In the\nMiddle where the dad meant to\nchange the kitchen's light bulb before going to work and ends up spending the\nentire day unravelling the thread of intermediary tasks that sneak themselves in\nthe way of his seemingly innocuous goal.\nSomewhere along the line, we're 3 month in that 2-week project, everybody's\ngetting fed up, and the deadline comes looming: we decide to implement only the\nhalf that's immediately doable, preserve the work-in-progress somewhere in our\nVCS of choice (Git, surely), close the remaining tasks as \"won't fix\" or discard\n(erm, \"retroactively postpone\", I mean) them to the infamous backlog, under the\n\"technical debt\" label.\nWe thought we'd be on top of things and could be surfing the wave\nof due features but ended up submerged under a rip tide of unknown\nunknowns violently revealing themselves; nobody's happy and we shipped\na half-baked product that we now tell the stakeholders was a perpetual\nstew all along.\nAt that story's post-mortem retrospective (you do these, right?), we conclude\nthat the failure to keep up with prerequisites discovered as we went lies mostly\non:\n\nthe staggering cost of unplanned cross-team collaboration, and\nthe lack of a clear, shared vision of what \"done\" means, possibly aggravated\nby some well-intended scope creep.\n\n\nIn the alternate reality where we'd have aptly assumed the responsibility of\nlaying out the foundations for successful project, we have spent some time\nupfront to ensure we'd build the right thing at the right time—when all the\nresources (human and other) would be suitably available and primed, then spent 2\nmore weeks actually taking on the 2-week job.\nOf course, this only works if we indeed start ahead of time, otherwise this\nplanning not only is directly delaying the project and eating into its allotted\ntime and resources, but also is doomed to be biased towards expediency as we're\nbasically discovering when would be the right time to begin the activity we're\ncurrently supposedly working on.\nConsidering the upstream preparations, it'll have taken somewhat more than the\nestimate, but still went smoothly.  Without juxtaposing it to how poorly it\ncould have gone, it's nothing to write home about...  So I shall write about it\nhere.\n\nIf you find yourself in an environment routinely bearing with projects being\nunceremoniously started and just as organically derailed, in-house products that\nhave aged into a mere maintenance burden, or teams that are perpetually putting\nout fires, you may want to consider shifting your perspective:\nOne simple job scheduled, discussed, planned and delivered on time is a success\nstory.\nIf a team consistently handles these straightforward tasks in that manner,\ndon't make the mistake of assuming they look good because their tasks are\neasy: their tasks\nare easy because they are that good.  They're giving you the value they sold\nyou on; in many contexts in the software industry, that is quite a great value.\nCelebrate, encourage, analyse and emulate these blueprints for success: this\nis where you can most reliably ensure your department will be more reminiscent\nof an icebreaker steadily and\nreliably ploughing its way through the Arctic, rather than a leaky oil\ntanker spilling its noxious entrails\nas it drifts helplessly in the open sea.\n","id":"https://ccjmne.sh/blog/ramblings/the-hidden-value-of-the-job-web-done/","title":"The hidden value of the job well done"},"https://ccjmne.sh/blog/ramblings/unfinished-software-migrations/":{"body":"\nThis is the sombrer branch of a dystopian choose-your-own-adventure essay\non systemic failures to carry through sizeable projects in \"enterprise\"\nenvironments.\nIts alternative write-up is found at: A systemic failure to follow\nthrough.\n\n\nSuppose that we have a problem.\nSuppose that our e-commerce Web app consists essentially of a\npatchwork of legacy \"enterprise\" Java front-and-back–end powered by\nApache Wicket (popular 2007–2012),\nApache Struts (2002–2007), Apache\nTapestry (2004–2007), or all of the above,\nand we never quite considered ever serving customers on mobile devices.\nOr suppose any sort of system deeply entangled with\neverything, including itself, some sort of living root\nbridge, except it's a whole\ntreetop dwelling, nothing but intertwined roots as far as the eye can see, a\ngnarled knitting of Gordian knots\nthat started out as a decision never formally taken and grew into a\ninstitutionalised way of life.\nWell, it's 2025 now, and it turns out that while the IT department never\nconsidered smartphones, tablets (or the fact that windows aren't always\nmaximised, and on a horizontal monitor with the default font size and zoom\nfactor), our customer service department did...

Name your micro-task, we are\nbuilding some specialised (read: contrived) mean to do it some sort of way.\nSoon enough, everything is ready, 90% of the job is done and\nall that remains is to migrate/adapt/rewrite everybody to El\nDorado.\n\nNow, onto the remaining 90% of the job (ha!): integrating the solution.\nEvery now and again we advocate for the new platform, but each team is\nresponsible for bringing their piece of the puzzle up to date, on their own\ntime: the feature requests for the established solution are still pouring in.\nYet the curators of its modernised counterpart aren't left idle, there is much\nthumb-twiddling in the works:\nWe establish ADRs, we keep expanding the procedures\nand making things yet simpler by identifying patterns and systematically\npreventing anybody from having to endure how the sausage is made: do not\nrepeat yourself—or anybody else, consistency is the opiate of the sophisticated\nmind,\nthis project is so DRY\nit could pass for a British\ncomedy.\n\nWe struggle to bring the two worlds to parity.
