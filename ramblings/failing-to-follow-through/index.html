<p>Suppose that we have a problem.</p>
<p>Suppose that our entire business communicates through some handcrafted marvel
of software architecture built by a few prolific souls who left the company 10 years
ago, in a language that today's scholars could only describe as <a rel="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin">Pig
Latin</a>.</p>
<p>Or suppose that our data centre runs on a fleet of systems so ancient that
their <code>glibc</code> can't be used to compile or run any sort of <code>ssh</code> software using
algorithms that modern tools would agree to work with.</p>
<p>Or suppose that the 700 modules, servers, libraries and what-have-yous that
comprise our solution all use the same general bundle of configuration
files, a happy, hairy, slimy chimera distributed by a <a rel="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine">Rube Goldberg
machine</a> of <code>cron</code> jobs
that only <a rel="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Bombadil">Tom Bombadil</a> can tame.
And they're cross-referencing one another.  And they're stashed across several
source repositories.  Hosted at different providers.</p>
<p>Or suppose that it'd be cool to use that shiny <a rel="external" href="https://blogs.oracle.com/javamagazine/post/text-blocks-come-to-java">"new" multiline Java
<code>String</code></a>.
In summary, suppose that we have a serious problem that calls for
all-hands-on-deck, cross-team, cross-discipline, focus-of-the-semester
remediation.</p>
<div class="hi">
<p>The new year hits, and we're even graced by the presence of some board member's
face in the fully remote kick-off meeting: the show is officially on the road!</p>
<p>Q1, spirits are high, advisory groups aplenty, meetings
eagerly planned and subsequently attended: <strong>the well-oiled
<a rel="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreadnought">Dreadnought</a> of progress is set in
motion</strong>.</p>
<p>Q2, meetings were planned recurrently to begin with; resources are temporarily
diverted, as is the custom; <strong>the battering ram of progress is still certainly
heading somewhere</strong>, as evidenced by the risk incurred, in leaning against it
for and early afternoon nap, of slumping off in its trail.</p>
<p>Q3, every other worker (in the idiomatic sense) has their 4-week vacation lined
up and every other worker (in the literal sense) is consequently overrun with
unprecedented and unexpected workload.  <strong>The rudimentary vehicle of progress is
still rumoured to be crawling</strong>.  The stakeholders are nowhere to be seen but,
what stakes, really?  The "place order" button is working, after all; <a rel="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_Is_Beautiful">life is
beautiful</a> and neither effort
nor indolence is rewarded nor punished.</p>
<p>Before the end of the year, <strong>our retroactively baseless, worn-out jalopy
of progress did indeed ram itself into a wall</strong>, there's no denying that,
<strong>but its battering prowess may have been greatly exaggerated</strong>.  It now
shares <a rel="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_Is_Beautiful">Tom Riddle's</a>
predicament in that it shall not any more be named.  It withered and
went away without as much as a whimper.  It was everybody's, therefore
it was nobody's; the corpse remains unclaimed and unidentified but,
<a rel="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four">comrade</a>, is it really dead
if the records don't show that we decided to kill it?</p>
</div>
<p><a rel="external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/341391-it-was-the-best-of-times-it-was-the-worst">It was the spring of hope, it was the winter of
despair</a>.<br>
As an effort, it was, as always, resounding, and
you may <a rel="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Castle_(novel)">join K. in inquiring of the authoritative
parties</a> about what
constitutes, indisputably, one of the endeavours of all times.</p>
<p>As far as history shall be concerned, the solution is all but established,
the time has passed and the resources were spent in accordance: <a rel="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effort_justification">in our
book</a>, it's a done task; but
to the keen mind, it's one more shipwreck elevated to the status of cultural
landmark, a new hurdle toughening the sell regarding possibly addressing the
original issue "once more".</p>
<p>Suppose that we had a problem...  Now the problem has its own meta problem.</p>
