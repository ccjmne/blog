  <p>So there is a task; it's yours.  It's ill-defined; that's not your fault.</p>
<p><strong>Your fault is presenting the seemingly irreconcilable, incomprehensible,
incomplete or otherwise irrational requirements as a blocker</strong> the next day
during our daily stand-up.  And I'm not even talking about how this privileged
time is for coordination, not for reporting—you're not in school any more.</p>
<p>In a few words, <strong>don't just wait around: address the problem.</strong>  You were
never brought here to carry on doing the dull thing you've come to expect
of yourself: we have machines for that, infallible tools working around the
clock and churning through any task (defined explicitly enough) faster than
you can click "assign to me".  You're supposedly here because we expect you to
<strong>function autonomously</strong>, and possibly function despite the unexpected.</p>
<p>Who knows, with a bit of drive, you might yourself operate beyond
expectations!<br>
Until then, heed these insights I want to share with you:</p>
<p>I know you've got a boss, a project manager, a scrum master, a team lead, a
product owner and that there's also that one guy in the team who knows better
that area and always takes it on, but I'll tell you here the reality: <strong>the one
thing you have that you should cater to is your responsibility</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>If you're lacking some resource, whatever it is, go acquire it.</strong><br>
The person that has what you need does have the 5 minutes to give it to you.
If you're worried they'd believe those precious minutes to be wasted on you,
chances are that you're <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-handicapping">pre-emptively making up obstacles to justify planned
mediocrity</a>, but surely that
shouldn't serve as a respectable alternative to actually trying.</p>
<p><strong>If your half-assed effort didn't pan out, try wholeheartedly.</strong><br>
Yes, you've left a comment on the Jira ticket and it's been
unanswered for a week; yes the guy's now on vacation; yes the
teacher's 12 minutes late...  Do you suppose it's time to <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/make_like_a_tree_and_leave">make like
a tree</a>—we
can't run the risk of them showing up before the hallowed
15-minute mark?  If they're not responsive enough in these
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_(M._C._Escher)">Escher-esque</a>
Atlassian machinations, hop on Teams; if they're on vacation, and their team
doesn't know, and your team doesn't know...  Just <strong>get started</strong>.<br>
You were entrusted with this, you can use your better judgement to kick it
off in the right direction.  Or switch things up, take this extra time and
opportunity to get familiar enough with the context to <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2012/04/28/shorter-letter">avoid over-engineering
it this once</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The mythical, elusive one person that may or may not hold the key isn't
that irreplaceable.</strong><br>
No, really, even if nobody else but "surely they" know, guess what: neither
do they.  They're just in that position where they have to decide whether
something needs to be done, but there's not one person that knows anything.
Assuming your business makes money, it takes at least 4 people to know what to
do: the customer service front-line (or analytics squad), the marketing crew,
the legal department, and the developers in the trenches.  Everybody in-between,
around and above is merely playing the "telephone game".<br>
Think of it this way: if you can't get it from them, it's just as well as if
they didn't have it.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostbusters_(song)">Who you gonna call?</a>
Nobody.  <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Captain_Phillips_(film)#Dialogue">Look at you, you're the captain
now.</a></p>
<p>Or decide not to do it, but don't dwell on it, and
don't tell me the next day that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oops!..._I_Did_It_Again_(song)">oops, you did it
again</a>.</p>
