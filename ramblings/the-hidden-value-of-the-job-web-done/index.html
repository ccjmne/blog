<article>
  <p>Once in a while, a project ends up completely off-course.  We end up having to
fix something that was never part of the original plan, something that appears
entirely unrelated to the actual problem we're attempting to solution: I
often have in mind <a rel="external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbSehcT19u0">that one opening to some episode of Malcolm In the
Middle</a> where the dad meant to
change the kitchen's light bulb before going to work and ends up spending the
entire day unravelling the thread of intermediary tasks that sneak themselves in
the way of his seemingly innocuous goal.</p>
<p>Somewhere along the line, <strong>we're 3 month in that 2-week project,</strong> everybody's
getting fed up, and the deadline comes looming: we decide to implement only the
half that's immediately doable, preserve the work-in-progress somewhere in our
<abbr title="Version Control System"><code>VCS</code></abbr> of choice (Git, surely), close
the remaining tasks as "Won't Fix" or discard (erm, <em>"retroactively postpone"</em>,
I mean) them to the infamous backlog, under the dreadfully omnipresent
"Technical Debt" label.</p>
<p>We thought we'd be on top of things and could be surfing the wave
of due features, but ended up submerged under a rip tide of unknown
unknowns violently revealing themselves; nobody's happy and we shipped
a half-baked product that we now tell the stakeholders was a <a rel="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_stew">perpetual
stew</a> all along.</p>
<p>At that story's post-mortem retrospective (you do these, right?), we conclude
that the failure to keep up with prerequisites discovered as we went lies mostly
on:</p>
<ul>
<li>the staggering cost of unplanned cross-team collaboration, and</li>
<li>the lack of a clear, shared vision of what "done" means, possibly aggravated<!-- by some [well-intended scope creep](@/ramblings/refine-and-do-the-job.md). TODO: LINKME -->
by some well-intended scope creep.</li>
</ul>
<div class="hi">
<p>In the alternate reality where we'd have aptly assumed the responsibility of
laying out the foundations for a successful project, we have <strong>spent some time
upfront to ensure we'd build the right thing at the right time</strong>—when all the
resources (human and other) would be suitably available and primed, then spent 2
more weeks actually taking on the 2-week job.</p>
<p>Of course, this only works if we indeed start <strong>ahead of time</strong>, otherwise this
planning not only is directly delaying the project and eating into its allotted
time and resources, but also is doomed to be biased towards expediency as we're
basically discovering <strong>when would be the right time to begin the activity we're
currently supposedly working on</strong>.</p>
<p>Considering the upstream preparations, it'll have taken somewhat more than the
estimate, but still went smoothly.  Without juxtaposing it to how poorly it
could have gone, it's nothing to write home about...  So I shall write about it
here.</p>
</div>
<p>If you find yourself in an environment routinely bearing with projects being
unceremoniously started and just as organically derailed, in-house products that
have aged into a mere maintenance burden, or teams that are perpetually putting
out fires, you may want to consider shifting your perspective:</p>
<p>One simple job substantiated, discussed, scheduled, planned and delivered on
time is a success story.</p>
<p>If a team consistently handles these straightforward tasks in that manner,
don't make <a rel="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_hoc_ergo_propter_hoc">the mistake of assuming they look good because their tasks are
easy</a>: <strong>their tasks
are easy because they are that good</strong>.  They're giving you the value they sold
you on; in many contexts in the software industry, that is quite a great value.</p>
<p>Celebrate, encourage, analyse and emulate these blueprints for success: this
is where you can most reliably ensure your department will be more reminiscent
of an <a rel="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icebreaker">icebreaker</a> steadily and
reliably ploughing its way through the Arctic, rather than a leaky <a rel="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_tanker">oil
tanker</a> spilling its noxious entrails
as it drifts helplessly in the open sea.</p>
