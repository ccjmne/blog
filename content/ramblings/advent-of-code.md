> Deck the [Git] tree with lines of logic, fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la.

There's my rendition of [_Deck the
Halls_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deck_the_Halls), for 'tis the season to be
jolly!

In some sort of reverse-[Cinderella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinderella)
blessing, just as her enchantment vanishes as the clock strikes the twelfth
hour, some uncharacteristically merry and serene mood washes over me as we ease
into the twelfth month.

It's that time of the year again, that comfortable December
that we've been building towards all the while.  And what
better celebration than the whimsy-spirited [_Advent of
Code_](https://adventofcode.com/2025/leaderboard/private)?

The <abbr title="Advent of Code">`AoC`</abbr> is a yearly event running from
December 1st through 25th[^only-12-days], just like contemporary Christian
[Advent calendars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar).

[^only-12-days]: Well, starting this year, **it'll "only" run from the 1st
through the 12th**, for several reasons, chief among them being [how demanding
it is to put together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oNOTknRTSU) each year.

<div class="hi">

So, what is it?  In a few words, it's **a collection of programming exercises,
lovingly crafted each year** over the course of quite a few months, by a single
creator, [Eric Wastl](https://was.tl/).  But over this fairly standard premise
come **three!** charming twists:

1. **the challenges get progressively harder as the month goes**, ranging from
frankly trivial, all the way to requiring truly savvy engineering.

2. each day proposes a first task, **then a second one that merely changes a
parameter and, innocently, cranks the challenge up** a (possibly quite serious)
notch.  Your naive algorithm may well work originally, then end up requiring
more time than what our best estimates suggest is left of Earth subsisting.

3. **each and every daily challenge is tied up in a lovely, quirky, pure and
wholesome scenario involving various fantastical shenanigans** in the wonderful
and whimsical world of the little Christmas helpers.  Not only that, but they
all build from one to the next to arrive at a culminating goal of addressing yet
another logistical nightmare in organising that celebration.

</div>

But the _Advent of Code_ wouldn't be complete without its rallying quality:
**the spirit of Christmas, for me and many others, is sublimed by this now
well-established tradition of working together** towards a common goal of having
fun honing and sharing our skills, helping one another out, competing (for those
who want to), claiming virtual achievement stars...

You can set up private "leader boards", where you don't necessarily have to
track how fast people got to implement their solution (they do come out at `6am`
where I live[^always-midnight-est]), but it's a nice way to encourage yourself
to earn more stars by completing the challenges, and maybe a good occasion to
**have some lengthy coffee break with your friends or colleagues** to work
through some particular task.

[^always-midnight-est]: For logistical reasons, the _Advent of Code_'s new
puzzles always systematically come out at a single instant across the world:
midnight <abbr title="Easter Standard Time, in New York">`EST`</abbr>, or <abbr
title="Greenwich Mean Time">`GMT`</abbr>`-5`.

You can join some of the wonderful communities of [online
streamers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_streamer) tackling
the exercises live.  You can dive into the [`r/adventofcode`
subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/) to share your solution and
explore that of others.  Some people make it as few lines of code as possible,
compute as fast as possible, use the most esoteric languages ever incepted...

A favourite of mine are **the masterful visualisations that
some folks never fail to deliver on**.  Web sites, videos,
[`ASCII` art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art) animations,
[`PICO-8`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PICO-8) implementations, you name it!

<div class="hi">

And, even if you mean to fly solo, this shall serve as one of the very best
excuses to build yet another home-made `AoC`-solving framework for oneself
(only to promptly abandon it half-baked before the next December peeks around
the corner), **try your hands at another language**, simply dip your toes in
software programming or whet and satiate your appetite for some fun, technical
challenge.

Will you join us in figuring out how to best help quantum
elephants find their way through some 8-dimensional
[Discworld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discworld_(world)),
where [turtles are currently re-stacking
themselves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down) in some
classical [Tower of Hanoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi)
scenario?

</div>

With its inauguration dating all the way back from 2015, **this charming
celebration turns 10 years old today**, and I can wholeheartedly say that it has
been playing a large part in making December my favourite time of the year.

Thank you, Eric Wastl, and the greater community, for this delightful
treat that unites programming enthusiasts, resonating even more than the
[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/) in our hearts.
