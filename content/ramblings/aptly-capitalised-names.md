[Gutenberg's printing press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press),
a sure cornerstone of technological advancement in respectable [4x
games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4X), did not only usher in the age of
enlightenment, but also solidified our familiar Latin alphabet into its
contemporary majuscule and minuscule forms.

Its influence is such that its operators' vernacular became the *de facto*
language of (colloquial) typography:

- the **"cases"** (lower and upper) actually used to refer to the physical boxes
  holding the movable types to be used in printing;
- these families themselves were **"fonts"**, from the French word for "cast
  iron", *"fonte"*;
- the **"leading"** was referring to the strips of lead placed between lines of
  type (and therefore pronounced *"ledding"*!);
- heck, we still talk today of **"the press"** when talking of the media in
  general!

Yet even now, we—the impersonal collective "we"—still come from time
to time to ask ourselves what "casing" would be most appropriate for the
occasion...  Or worse yet, not even bat an eye as we read of the *git* [sic]
<abbr title="Version Control System">VCS</abbr>.

  **It's *Git*.**<br> There's also _Git_<strong style="text-decoration:
underline;">H</strong>_ub_ and _Git_<strong style="text-decoration:
underline;">L</strong>_ab_, but _Gitea_; _Bit_<strong style="text-decoration:
underline;">K</strong>_eeper_ but _Bit_<strong style="text-decoration:
underline;">b</strong>_ucket_; _Source_<strong style="text-decoration:
underline;">F</strong>_orge_ but _Code_<strong style="text-decoration:
underline;">b</strong>_erg_...

Ultimately, while we do not have to like how *NVIDIA* or *Neovim* are spelled,
we can still strive to get it right.  Let's jump right in, alphabetically:

{{ hr(class="alternating-list-marker") }}

- It's [**braille**](https://www.brailleauthority.org/capitalization/capitalization.html)

- It's [**ccjmne**](https://github.com/ccjmne)

- It's [**ECMAScript**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript)

- It's [**FFmpeg**](https://ffmpeg.org/)

  Seriously; for *"Fast-Forward <abbr title="Moving Picture Experts
  Group">MPEG</abbr>"*, check out [this thread on the FFmpeg mailing
  list](https://ffmpeg.org/pipermail/ffmpeg-devel/2006-February/thread.html#10142).

  A quaint bit I found there: *"[...] Linus insisting on using the evil
  BitKeeper system for the Linux source (although IIRC they moved to something
  more sane eventually)"*.

- It's [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/)

- It's [**GNOME**](https://www.gnome.org/)

  While the project has been rebranding lately, there is no (publicly disclosed)
  intention by the [GNOME Foundation](https://foundation.gnome.org/) to alter
  the beloved name and logo anytime soon, though [the community is talking about
  this](https://cassidyjames.com/blog/gnome-foot-logo-rebrand/).

  Oh, and, as seems to be customary within the GNU community, this acronym is
  rather a ["backronym"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backronym), purportedly
  standing for *"GNU Network Object Model Environment"*.

- It's [**GNU**](https://www.gnu.org/)

  A most notorious recursive acronym, standing for *"GNU's Not Unix"*.

- It's [**GnuPG**](https://gnupg.org/)

  Another masterful initialism, *"GNU Privacy Guard"* offers the `gpg` utility
  as an alternative to the `pgp` tool implementing *"Pretty Good Privacy"*.

- It's the [**Internet**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet)

- It's an [**iPad**](https://www.apple.com/iphone/), an **iPhone**, an **iMac**

- It's [**LaTeX**](https://www.latex-project.org/)

  Not the rubbery material, and certainly not pronounced like it either.

- It's [**macOS**](https://www.apple.com/macos/)

- It's [**niri**](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri)

- It's [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/), [**Next.js**](https://nextjs.org/) and [**Nuxt**](https://nuxt.org/)

  Ah, it used to be *NuxtJS*, quite amusingly.  But we shouldn't care much
  anyway, since **Svelte** is really the superior alternative in all matters.

- It's [**NVIDIA**](https://www.nvidia.com/)

- It's [**Sass**](https://sass-lang.com/), but it's [**SCSS**](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax/#scss)

  I can actually see the casing difference actually making sense even
  intuitively, when you consider their history.

- It's [**Syncthing**](https://syncthing.net/)

  Let's appreciate [their
  FAQ](https://docs.syncthing.net/users/faq.html#is-it-syncthing-syncthing-or-syncthing) addressing this very question so clearly.

- It's [**tmux**](https://github.com/tmux)

- It's [**Unicode**](https://home.unicode.org/)

- It's [**Vim**](https://www.vim.org/)

  Well-known to mean *"Vi IMproved"*, yet it originally stood for the less
  glamorous *"Vi IMitation"*.

- It's [**VS Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

  Well, it may not seem like it, but both are used even in official
  communication.  The community overwhelmingly settled on *VS Code*, in part
  because **Visual Studio** is an entirely different tool.

- It's the (World Wide) [**Web**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web)

  We few pained by the missing hyphen in "world-wide" may find solace in the
  common parlance [largely favouring "worldwide"](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=worldwide%2Cworld+wide%2Cworld-wide&year_start=1900&corpus=en) altogether.

- It's [**Wi-Fi**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi)

  Ahem.  I'd love to tell you how it came to be called that, but I'd frankly do
  a poorer job than a lot of articles out there.  I have in mind a particular
  documentary, which I sadly cannot find again.
