We've pretty much always had _"artificial intelligence"_ in our lives: the
[ghosts chasing Pac-Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghosts_(Pac-Man)) in its
eponymous arcade game from 1980 operate according to 4 sets of rules (each their
own): that's **Artificial Intelligence** (`AI`), too.

I mean to talk here of **Machine Learning** (`ML`), the subset of `AI` that has
been making waves in the last few years, and most specifically about **Large
Language Models** (`LLM`), which are capable of (essentially) conversing just as
humans would[^are-we-sentient-yet].  I'll keep referring to these as `AI`, for
it sadly is the established vernacular.

[^are-we-sentient-yet]: Artificial **sentience** is yet to be incepted
electronically, to be best of my understanding.  Although, who am I to
judge—[am I even conscious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness) to
begin with?

<div class="hi">

I'd like to start with something that's not often talked about: the `AI`
that's now available to us is a huge achievement, something that'd been
dreamt since the inception of computing, perhaps even before.  In my teenage
years, I grew up with [Asimov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov)'s
_Foundation_ and _Robot_ series.  I also remember the iconic
[HAL 9000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAL_9000)'s eerie _"I
think you know what the problem is just as well as I do"_,
[K.I.T.T.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KITT) as the original
[J.A.R.V.I.S.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.A.R.V.I.S.),
[GLaDOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLaDOS)'s sinister humour in yet another
of Valve's game-changing accomplishments, and _Star Wars_' beloved [C-3PO and
R2-D2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droid_(Star_Wars)) doing their best [Laurel
and Hardy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurel_and_Hardy) impression.

That's quite a few acronyms[^acronyms], come to think of it.  We should consider
christening (ha!) our first **Artificial General Intelligence** (`AGI`)
something like SAGE, for _Self-Adapting General Entity_.  Or whatever OVERLORD
might spell out, to tease the soothsayers.  But I digress.

[^acronyms]:
    - **K.I.T.T.** stands for _Knight Industries Two Thousand_,
    - **J.A.R.V.I.S.** for _Just A Rather Very Intelligent System_,
    - **GLaDOS** for _Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System_, and
    - **HAL** for _Heuristically Programmed Algorithmic Computer_ (go figure).

    The names of *Star Wars*' iconic droids are more the result of chance than
    deliberate acronyms.

**We are now somewhere.**  We can, albeit at a strenuous (if not staggering)
computational cost, have machines that can "understand" and respond in a natural
language.  It is now unequivocally workable as a long-awaited solution to be
refined in the years to come.

</div>

As a programming companion, however, it's of **very little use to me**.

{{ hr() }}

**I like my craft.**  I refined it enormously and have achieved some
mastery in some regards that I'm certain is far from being available
to the general public, were they even armed with the _World Wide Web_
[[sic]](@/ramblings/aptly-capitalised-names.md) and aided by some companions of
the artificial kind.

<!-- (@/flight-manual/switch-audio-sink-gpt-vs-me). TODO: LINKME -->

If I use a tool to author and compose code for me, I rob myself of the
opportunity and experience of thinking through the problem, arriving at a
solution, possibly trudging on my way there and only _then_ realising that a
smoother path should be available.

After some decades of this, the most excellent of us end up developing some
sense for these mechanisms, as we've built similar things in different ways,
in different cultural and technological contexts, using different tools, for
different purposes.

{{ hr() }}

**None of this corresponds to any sort of experience that the current
`LLM`s could at all contemplate acquiring:** they have no experience of
their own.  They exist in a fantasy world dreamed up from the weighted
statistically average (or popular?) amalgamation of (only) the written report
of third parties; it certainly doesn't "learn" in any human sense.  [Richard
Sutton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_S._Sutton) (a foundational figure
in modern artificial intelligence) puts it well: _learning isn't just about
training, it's an active process_.

The general-purpose programming assistant is **nothing like having a
general-purpose tool** that would have been careful crafted to perform a
specific task, possibly rather through _reinforcement learning_ rather than mere
vaguely supervised mimicry training on a large corpus of text.

And of course, with general-purpose chatting engines come the yet-to-be-solved
issues regarding, off the top of my head:

- outright dangerous rhetoric or instructions,
- "hallucinations" (i.e., confidently stating falsehoods),
- biases inherited from the training data, and
- intellectual property and data privacy concerns.

There's also the seeping, encroaching problem of the horrifyingly inadequate
[appeal to authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority)
bias that we are getting increasingly subject to, using sources whose influence
only gets further and further ahead of their competency.

{{ hr() }}

My third point is that, under the hypothesis that we are to keep signing off on
the code that an `AI` produces for us, the argument should be made that—to the
fanatic developer at least—**the mechanical act of curating the codebase is
certainly not the bottleneck** in building perennial software.

On that note, a close colleague of mine confided just this week that reviewing
code may more strenuous than authoring it, depending on how diligent one wants
to be.  It may have to do with the pull in opposing directions: you need to
appropriate the entire context in the first place, but wouldn't quite dare, at
this point, even considering alternative solutions.

In any case, **correctly identifying and contextualising the problem, the
solution space, the implicit and explicit constraints, the trade-offs to
be made** with regards to maintainability, performance, security, etc. are
indisputably the more costly (and valuable) parts of the process.  Having the
artificial assistant **execute** the plan is not, in the general cases where the
alternative would be that I personally fly through text documents, much of a
time-saver.

And again, that's assuming the end result is correct under scrutiny—which it
isn't always, let alone exemplary, let alone graceful.

<div class="hi">

In short, I am, intrinsically, **somebody that does stuff**.  Not because I
can't delegate, not because I need the stuff done (though sometimes I do), but
because I was plagued and blessed with a profound obsession for refining my
craft.  And I was afforded the luxury of being born just in time for not only
software being a major, obvious, lucrative industry, but also the notion that
care, skill and experience can make a tremendous difference in the quality of
the resulting product.

I come from a time when every kid at school heard that we wouldn't always have a
calculator in our pocket; when, if we played video games, it'd be the few that
were available, over and over; when the first consoles were requiring great
ingenuity just to have a counter-melody play over the main theme and sprites
would flicker to work around memory constraints; when access to a digital, _let
alone on-line!_ encyclopaedia was an indulgence; in summary, I come from a time
where the family camera and the family computer would never have been thought to
soon be available as a single, personal device.  And I'm not that old!

Yet, the [Discord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discord)
of today is substantially more sluggish than the [MSN
Messenger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSN_Messenger) of
yesteryear.  It does far more, certainly, but I do realise that
hardware and networking have come a long, long way since I took my
first steps into [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRC) servers and
[BBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system) Websites; to my
understanding, there still is room for some excellence even in the **execution
of the vision**.

</div>

`AI` will get better.  It already is of great value as a preliminary to some
search engine queries.  It's pretty great at getting some vaguely mushy
implementation that mostly does the thing you asked it for.  But that is not
remotely enough to pique my fervent interest:

It does what we asked it for...  But what if we were misguided?  The
well-travelled quote _"the customer is always right"_ should be followed by:
_"in matters of taste"_.

We built what the marketing department sold...  But what of the
[-ilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_system_quality_attributes)?

What of the cut-throat, no-nonsense, ruthless pragmatism where one could
want to do away with dependencies and frameworks altogether?  If made
to optimise, could it avoid doing it prematurely—the [root of all
evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_optimization), as proposed by the
illustrious [Donald Knuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth)?

We've arrived at a set of nascent tools that will help and get
better.  Once again, a new fad is upon us, just as the past two decades
brought us the [Big Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data)
craze, the [NoSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL) movement, the
[Microservices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices) bandwagon,
the [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST) cult, the [Event
Sourcing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_architecture) phase...
In some contexts, these are the right tools; in general, they merely serve to
indicate when about were these solutions designed and built.

Will our own systems and products stand the test of time, or shall we right
away mandate [Vibe Coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding) to faster
implement complexity[^faster-implement-complexity]?

[^faster-implement-complexity]: Being a proponent of radical simplicity, I
may smugly smirk at the idea, yet I shudder at the realisation that some serious
people are indeed in favour of such mandates, and in position to put them into
practice.
