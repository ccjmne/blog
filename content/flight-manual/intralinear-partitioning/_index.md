   Professionally, I put code together. Intimately, I am compelled to make
it neat: I get closer to that goal by wielding non-printable characters like
monochrome photography uses light, with _purpose_.

   The current _status quo_ regarding whitespace, in my line of work, limits our
stylistic expression:

- vertically to the **linefeed[^esoteric-vertical-whitespace] (coalescing into
  blank lines**), to pack together logical blocks of data or instructions, and
- horizontally **to the beginning of the line (in the form of
  indentation)**, to delineate the hierarchy of our otherwise strictly
  vertically-topologically-laid-out content.

 But here's the thing: the taxonomy of text shouldn't be limited to paragraphs
and lines.<br>
   Let's go bidimensional!

[^esoteric-vertical-whitespace]: Let's not talk of
the [CR](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+000D),
[VT](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+000B) or
[FF](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+000C) here.
