Sprinkle in some couple of years of not opening the `man`ual, several
generations of learners whose main (if not sole) source of know-how and
information are the first handful of results yielded by their search engine, and
you have it: *rampant shell illiteracy*.

The symptoms?

OTEL_ENDPOINT=$(cat /opt/mercateo/conf/meerkat/catalog-webapp.properties | grep 'otel.endpoint' | sed 's/^.*=//g')

or UUOC

Despite being the most prominent sign of cluelessness, `cat` isn't the sole
weapon of the serial perpetrator: combining short `awk`, `sed`, `grep` (and
others I'm surely forgetting) also tells a tale of acute `man`ual anaemia.
