<!-- <p>"One meticulous fellow"</p> -->

I publish some technical [flight manual](@/flight-manual/) that curates
practical guides towards mastering your software development craft.

I also share some [ramblings](@/ramblings/) that are more conceptual or
less grounded in relevance and practicality, but may be consumed more
recreationally—or precautionarily.

   I am fairly slow and deliberate.<br>
   I intend to keep producing approximately one article per week, but my
propensity for ranting tangents significantly hinders the production of articles
going straight to the point.<br>
   If you stick around a short while, I'm sure you'll come to find the irony in
that.

## User guide

This Website's colour scheme automatically adjusts to your preference as
[indicated by your Web browser](@/flight-manual/web-media-user-preferences.md),
which should forward that of your desktop environment; though it currently looks
better in **light** mode.

Web browsers supporting [View
Transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API)
will animate, in a non-nauseating manner, various anchor points as you peruse
the site. This functionality may be disabled by indicating, through your browser
again, your preference for reduced motion.

Links like [this one](#) point to other places on this very blog; external
references such as [that
one](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/rel#external)
are annotated with an arrow pointing to the up and right.
