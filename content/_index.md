<div class="hi">

I curate here a technical [flight manual](@/flight-manual/_index.md) that
publishes practical guides towards mastering your software development craft.

I also share some [ramblings](@/ramblings/_index.md) that are more conceptual
or less grounded in relevance and practicality, but may be consumed more
recreationally—or precautionarily.

   I am fairly slow and deliberate.<br>
   I intend to keep putting out articles at the approximate rate of one
per week, but my propensity for ranting tangents significantly hinders the
production of articles getting to the point at all, let alone straight.<br>
   If you stick around a short while, I'm sure you'll come to find the irony in
that.

You'll find some meta information regarding the technology stack that this Web
site is built upon in its [colophon](@/colophon.md).
