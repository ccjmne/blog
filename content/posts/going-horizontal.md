Professionally, I put code together. Intimately, I am compelled to make it neat:
one of the ways I achieve this is by wielding non-printable characters like
monochrome photography uses light, with *purpose* and finesse.

The current status quo regarding white-space limits our stylistic devices:

- vertically to the linefeed [^esoteric-vertical-whitespace]—coalescing into
  blank lines, to pack together logical blocks of data or instructions, and
- horizontally to the beginning of the line—in the form of
  indentation, to delineate the hierarchy of our otherwise strictly
  vertically-topologically-laid-out content.

But here's the thing: the taxonomy of text shouldn't be limited to paragraphs
and lines.  
Let's go bidimensional!

[FF](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+000C) here.
